# Beef

## Overview of Project

We are looking to document and discover bacteria that are able to synthesize proteins and taste like beef. We have partnered with Improbable Beef, to research different bacteriaspecies, and find the best bacteria to  use to synthesize into fake beef. We believe this bacteria may be found in some human belly buttons. We have gathered research from people's navals from across the country. This website shows the data we have gathered from our research.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a web application to display belly button data for each person in this analysis.
